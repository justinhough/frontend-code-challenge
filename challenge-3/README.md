# Challenge 3 Instructions

For this challenge, create a custom color palette using a set of 4 predefined colors.


## Requirements

- Use the build tool that you constructed in Challenge 0.
- Using the 4 colors defined in the Assets section below create custom classes that change the text color of an element.
- Colors need to have defined classes for default, light, and dark versions.
- Generate the light and dark colors using `lighten()` and `darken()` as referenced below in the Sass documentation.
- Colors should be no more than 20% difference (lighter or darker) from the default color
- Using `index.html`, create elements for each color class (12 total) to show the various color changes.
- Create HTML elements in `index.html` to show the color changes for backgrounds and text.


## Assets

- red: `#d82430`
- blue: `#005e95`
- green: `#3f6b6e`
- blue: `#0079bf`

## Resources

Review the Sass documentation topics about [@each](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#each) for more ideas on how to accomplish the challenge.

This challenge is also dependent upon understanding of the usage of [HSL Functions](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html), however, you only need to take a look at the documentation for [Lighten Instance](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#lighten-instance_method) and [Darken Instance](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#darken-instance_method)
